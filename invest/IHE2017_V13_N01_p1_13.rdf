Title: Historia Global vs. Eurocentrismo: revisión historiográfica, análisis de consumo y un caso de estudio comparativo entre China y Europa (1730-1808)
Abstract: This paper focuses on the impact of the discipline of Global History in recent decades, paying particular attention to studies on consumption and circulation of new goods in European and Asian markets. The main objective of this article is, therefore, to present a historiographical review on the impact of Global History, in which it can be observed that, in the case of studies on consumption, in particular, has had an obvious Eurocentric focus. The analysis of the British world, and its colonies, as engine of the first industrialisation, has been one of the main causes that have led towards such Eurocentric focus. This approach began to change with the growing interest in the study of China and its role in the world economy. Thus, this essay presents a historiographical review of both spaces, concluding with a comparative case study between Macau and Marseille as trans-national ports. This project is in its preliminary phases; therefore, it is only showing the principal lines.
