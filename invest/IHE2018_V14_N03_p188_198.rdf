Title: Una aproximación a las tarifas ferroviarias para viajeros en España (1844-1935)
Abstract: The issue of traffic rates is understudied in Spanish railway historiography. Its analysis is complex, due to the dispersal of data and the constant changes in the ways it was originally collected. Besides, the general tariff had a large number of special regimes that companies used to stimulate demand and improve operational results. In this paper, we propose a diachronic study for the 1844-1935 period. We will highlight the key moments in the development of tariff policies by railway companies, under the supervision of the State. Also, we will make an estimate of the evolution of average railway ticket prices in Spain and analyze how it affected the general characteristics and habits of the users.
