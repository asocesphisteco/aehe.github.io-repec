Title: El compromiso social en los Principios de economía política y en la Sujeción de las mujeres de John Stuart Mill (con las contribuciones de Harriet Taylor Mill)
Abstract: This paper consists of a re-reading of three works by John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor: the Principles of Political Economy (1848), The Subjection of Women (1869) both by J.S. Mill and Harriet Taylor’s essay, “The Emancipation of Women” (1851). The paper seeks to reinterpret these texts, seeing them as part of a joint pool of ideas and an explicit social and political programme set out by the two authors, a programme inspired by their wish to improve the lot in society, above all, of women and of the working classes. The ideas which underlie this programme have been classified under five headings: tradition and custom as stumbling blocks to social progress; education as a fundamental element in personal development; the right to vote and to be elected; freedom of access to the labour market; and finally the future advancement in the condition of the working classes.
