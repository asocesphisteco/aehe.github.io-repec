Title: El Instituto de Crédito de las Cajas de Ahorros (1933-1962). Un instrumento al servicio de las cajas
Abstract: This work tries to shed light on the history of one of the cooperation institutions that savings banks created to compete in a more integrated financial market. Together with the CECA, the institutional representation body, the ICCA was intended to provide financial and services support to savings banks. During the period analyzed, which goes from the birth of the ICCA until 1962, when it fell under government control, the actions of this institution were directed by savings banks to protect their interests and the ICCA became a useful instrument for them to use against the government departments’ intentions to acquire and condition savings banks’ resources. The article also speaks about the capital evolution of the institution and the benefits that it gave to their owners, the savings banks.
