Title: Empresas familiares y acuerdos cooperativos en el metal español: el caso de las industrias del alambre de hierro y acero (1880-1974)
Abstract: Family ownership, reduced size of productive centers, and concentration are historical trends that characterize the development of the Spanish iron and steel wire firms in international comparison. Agreements at regional level between the most significant family firms of the sector allowed coordination, which proved to be useful to avoid absorptions and to keep family control in some of the most important firms during more than a century.
