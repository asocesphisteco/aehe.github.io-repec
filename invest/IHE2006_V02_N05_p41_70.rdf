Title: Fiscalidad real y fiscalidad municipal en Castilla durante el siglo XVII: el caso de Madrid
Abstract: This article studies the interrelation between royal and municipal taxation in Castile during the 17th century through the analysis of the case of Madrid. After the introduction, the second part describes the main royal taxes levied in the city, while the third studies municipal ones. The fourth part deals with those royal taxes transferred by the Crown to Madrid after 1653 in return for the substantial monetary services provided. These different taxes are shown at an aggregate level in fifth part. The series obtained shows how while the importance of Madrid as a source of fiscal revenues for the Crown fell during the second half of the century, its role as supplier of monetary services aroused. As a whole, the sums paid by the capital inhabitants both to the royal and municipal treasuries grew throughout the century. Finally, the sixth part discusses the series after deflating it by New Castile price index between 1621 and 1700.
