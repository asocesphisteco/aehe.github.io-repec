Title: Nacionalizando el capital bancario: Banesto y Paribas (1902-1927)
Abstract: The Banco Español de Crédito (Banesto) was founded by the big French bank Paribas in 1902. In the first decades of 20th century, economic nationalism increased in Spain, as the bad relationship between Spanish and French directors of Banesto reflected. Finally, in 1927, during Primo de Rivera’s dictatorship, the bank became to be completely controlled by the national capital. Using new archival sources, this work identifies the main conflicting issues between Spaniards and foreigners. It contributes also to the debate in economic history on the relationship between political power and business elites in King Alfonso XIII’s Spain.
