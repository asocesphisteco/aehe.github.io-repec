Title: From a Family Company to an Information and Communication Technology Multinational: the case of Amper, 1976-2003
Abstract: The article addresses the patterns of survival of a telecommunication company with indigenously based technology in a context of increasing market liberalization and integration, which nevertheless maintains its oligopolistic structure. As for the methodology, the narrative prevails, since it describes the vicissitudes of Amper, which are not well known as a whole, although they have been repeatedly pointed out in isolated events. This narrative of the trajectory is based on a variety of sources, which ensures the reliability of the research results. Among them, the primary ones stand out, that is, those of Amper itself, the press and the CNMV, imitating the Minutes of the Board of Directors, which are not available at present. The analysis of the trajectory is based on various sources, among which Amper's own stand out. The article is structured in four main sections, which include the factors of Amper's expansion, the internationalization of the company in its various facets, corporate partnership with multinationals and divestments and segregations.
