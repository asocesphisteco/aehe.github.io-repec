Title: Banqueros españoles en París (1820-1940)
Abstract: This paper presents a first approach to the study of the presence and activity of different Spanish bankers operating in Paris between 1820 and 1940. This study also pays particular attention to the trajectory of three different banking houses that were able to survive their respective founders (the Uribarren-Abaroa Bank, the Mijtans-Movellan Bank, and the Gil Bank). An analysis is also made on the origin of the capital base that allowed these Banking houses, on how the American horizon was present in its activity, and what were the main sources of their activity, as well as the links that these bankers and their Banking houses had with Spanish capitalism.
