Title: State Aids for restructuring Spanish Steel Industry in European Perspective 
Abstract:  The aim of this article is to make a comparison of public assistance provided during the  restructuring of the steel industry in Spain and in the European Community of Coal and Steel from 1975 to 1988. We have used both primary and printed sources from different institutions: steel Spanish companies, Spanish steel organization (Unesid), European Community and Spanish agencies and public bodies and reports from the European Commission. The work concludes that the main difference between the Spanish and European Community steel policies was not so much on the amount of the public resources but rather on the use of them in the restructuring process, especially since the 1980s. So while in the EEC steel aids were granted only in exchange for the elimination of surplus capacity, in Spain not adjustment was made until its accession to the European Communities on 1 January 1986.
