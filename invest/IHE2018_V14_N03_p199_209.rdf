Title: Bunge and his first fiftieth anniversary in Brazil (1905–1955): The construction of an economic group
Abstract: This article studies the growth of the multinational Bunge in Brazil from 1905 until its fiftieth anniversary in 1955. The key question is how Bunge, in an economy of incipient industrialization, became an economic group. Initial investments in wheat milling—which spread to various other sectors—made this possible. Primary data from the Bunge Memory Center in Sao Paulo served as the main source of company data. We show Bunge's growth and transformation into an economic group as it bought competitors, increased the capacity of its mills, diversified products, and formed part of communities through its Foundation's activities. Bunge innovated by launching new merchandize. Its leaders were pioneers in several business areas, who occupied the country and reinvested the capital in new companies.
