Title: Análisis comparado de las trayectorias estratégicas de empresas siderúrgicas latinoamericanas. Desarrollo interno y contexto histórico
Abstract: Large Latin American companies which remain under family control increasingly employ professionals at the executive level and have part of their capital in the stock market. This is the case of Hylsa/Hylsamex, property of the Alfa Group (Mexico), and of Siderca (Ternium) and Siderar (Tenaris) belonging to Techint (Argentina). They followed similar and different strategies along the last decades, until in 2005 Techint acquired Hylsamex and integrated it into its transnational Ternium. These divergent strategies – Alfa abandoned steel production, while Techint concentrated on it – have taken place within the same sector context, so this article explores the role played in these decisions by their national contexts and their own internal development. Comparative historical analysis is used in order to contrast strategies and nacional contexts.
