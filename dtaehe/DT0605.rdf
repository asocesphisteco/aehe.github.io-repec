Title: Series De Deflactores Corcheros Desde 1900
Abstract:  The aim of this work is to elaborate series of deflators, for whole twentieth century, of three representative products in the cork business: raw cork, corkwood in planks and stoppers of natural cork. Given that prices of these products are not available, the data bases for reconstruction are, on one hand, unitary values of production and exports from Portugal and Spain and, on the other hand, unitary ones of United Kingdom’s imports. By using these values, selected after different tests of coherence and credibility, Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher’s indexes and a “synthetic cork deflator” are calculated. Then, a preliminary analysis about the unitary values as a proxy to the prices during the second half of twentieth century is realized. At last, the main figures which have been employed to the building of the deflators are shown in a statistical appendix.
