Title: Matemáticas, fiscalidad y crítica de la Escuela Clásica. El pensamiento liberal de José Alonso López
Abstract: José Alonso López is among the most suggestive figures of the first Spanish
liberalism. Some of the most outstanding features in his thought are the object of this article: the links between political and economic liberalism; his criticisms to economic abstractions detached from factual analysis; the use of advanced mathematical methods; and his singular proposition of an income tax with progressive rates.
