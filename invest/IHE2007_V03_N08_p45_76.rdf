Title: El comercio holandés y la integración de espacios económicos entre Cádiz y el Báltico en tiempos de guerra (1699-1723)
Abstract: Relationship between politics and trade has directly or indirectly influenced the evolution of market and maritime route integration in the Modern Age. A highly momentous time of wars between the XVII and the XVIII centuries has been chosen, in an attempt to carry out an analysis, from an economic and regional point of view. Historical and political factors combined with quantification on navigation have been integrated, in order to understand how that provoked a shift in vested interests war, as a destabilising agent and speculation, affected the maritime routes that linked areas and spaces. At the same time, we try to show how mercantile interests overcame the difficulties inherent in maintaining the superstructure of commercial relations. The route between Amsterdam and Cádiz is the chosen example of this, as it was a vital commercial line between the Baltic and the South of the Iberian Peninsula.
