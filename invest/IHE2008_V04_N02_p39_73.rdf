Title: El gasto público en formación profesional industrial en España (1857-1935)
Abstract: The development of the industrial vocational education for qualified workers and technicians has been considered a key factor for the success of the industrialization, mainlyduring the second technological revolution. Between 1857 and 1935 the Spanish vocational education supply and demand increased, due to the role of the public administration. This fact should be analysed taking into account the general process of institutionalisation of the educative system. The objective of this paper is to measure the expenditure effort made by the public administrations in order to develop this kind of industrial teachings. The point of view of the expenditure should let us make a first appraisal about whether the development of the educative supply was enough to promote the industrial development of the country or not.
