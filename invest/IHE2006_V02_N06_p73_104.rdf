Title: Reformas arancelarias y comercio exterior de trigo en España: el fin de la prohibición de importar trigo (1849-1869)
Abstract: This paper analyses some factors that supported the Spanish ban to import wheat between 1849 and 1869. Through the study of the parliamentarian debates, the government documents, informs of the economic agents, and the series of wheat prices, the paper tries to fix the function of the ban to import wheat in the liberal regime. It is concluded that coastal cities could get foreign wheat as cheap as Spanish wheat. However, the ban could have been replaced with customs duties due to the increase of the wheat prices in the international markets. Nevertheless, the political obstacles subsisted and the reform failed. When the political regimen changed, the ban was repealed.
