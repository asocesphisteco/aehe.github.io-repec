Title: Industrializando la España interior: El ensamblaje del Renault 4CV en la “FASA de Valladolid”, 1951-1958
Abstract: Fabricación de Automóviles SA (FASA) was founded in Valladolid in 1951. FASA owned the licence to manufacture the Renault 4CV in Spain, and between 1953 and 1958 produced 26,298 units, which represented 29% of the total Spanish output. The period was marked by disagreements both between the Spanish partners and between the Spanish partners and Renault, the technology supplier, and by the need to satisfy the requirements of domestic production. Drawing on unpublished primary sources of information (the Minutes of the Board of Directors and the Shareholders’ Meetings) the article analyses the development of FASA during its early years. The article explores the hypothesis that the developer of FASA decided to locate the factory in Valladolid for personal reasons. Moreover, it shows that the fact that the Spanish market was closed was the main factor in obliging Renault to grant the manufacturing licences.
