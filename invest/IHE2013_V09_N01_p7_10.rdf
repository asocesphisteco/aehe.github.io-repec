Title: Another brick in the wall? A comment on Francesco Boldizzoni's The Poverty of Clio  
Abstract: A book that reflects on the state-of-the-art in Economic History and discusses the different approaches of current and past research is highly welcome. Fortunately, Economics, History and Economic History, are nowadays fluently using multi-dimensional approaches to development, in which belief systems, culture and values play an important role. We must apply the same tools of analysis to our contemporary production. Unfortunately, the study of research methodology and of the History of Economic Thought has been losing ground in the education of economists, as much as the study of Economics is considered useless in the education of historians. In this context, every attempt to bridge the gap, to critically approach and to promote the link between history and economics is a welcome contribution.
