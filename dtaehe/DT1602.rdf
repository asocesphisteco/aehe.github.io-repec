Title: Una aproximación a la historia del ferrocarril en Brasil (1850-1950): Legislación, empresas y capitales británicos
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to study the long-term Brazilian railways, between 1850 and 1950, since the beginning of the construction of the first railways until the end of British hegemony. We understand that the history of the railways shows how few cases the effects of the processes of mobility of factors that boosted the dissemination of the first and second industrial revolution. Brazil is a good example. The early development of the railways and the presence of British capital, in a time when the state was still in the process of consolidation, reinforcing the theory of dependency that has been described by many as an informal empire. The large size of the territory, which led to the emergence of networks of regional vocation that had no connection with each other, the crucial importance of export flows, with special emphasis of coffee, in the configuration of the network from the inside to periphery, and continuous adaptation legislation to facilitate business financing, are some of the points on which we focus our analysis.
