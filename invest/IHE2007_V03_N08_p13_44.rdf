Title: Expansión ultramarina y economía vitivinícola. El ejemplo de Canarias (1500-1550)
Abstract: The colonization of the Canary Islands at the end of the 15th century induced the foundation and growth of the first insular and Atlantic viticulture, promoted by the ultramarine expansion of the Corona of Castile. In little more than twenty years, the new producers were supplying both the domestic and the Northwest European markets, as well as the new ones created by the colonial expansion of the Iberian Kingdoms. This article examines the strategies that encouraged the development of this new and competitive viticulture, and insists on the role played by institutional factors as well as by the Portuguese and Castilian colonial determination of developing, at the Canary Islands, a wine production tied to the international market.
