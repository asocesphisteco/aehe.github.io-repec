Title: Aproximación a la historia de la industria de equipos y componentes de automoción en España 
Abstract: The automotive components industry —nowadays the third Spanish industrial sector— arose in Spain at the beginning of the 20th Century. Its development was slow, as was the development of the local automobile industry, but before 1936 it had achieved a significant size and was in process of growth and modernization. The Spanish Civil War and the industrial policy of the forties slowed down this process, but in the fifties the industry grew quickly while the automobile industry took off. The rapid growth of the supplier industry between 1950 and 1970 took place in a protectionist framework, which limited its modernization and caused shortage of components. But after the liberalization of the seventies, it succeeded in modernizing and internationalizing, although this was to a great extent attributable to the multinational companies established in Spain.
