Title: Social Differentials in the Biological Standard of Living during the Decline of Industrialization in Andalusia: A District-level Analysis in Antequera 
Abstract:  Anthropometric history has shed light on some consequences of industrialization and urbanization on the biological dimensions of living standards across different areas of Spain. Yet the impact of these processes on specific segments of the population together with the magnitude of intra-urban differences, remain largely unexplored in this country. This paper presents and discusses male height differentials by occupation and urban districts in the industrial town of Antequera (Andalusia, Southern Spain) between 1879 and 1899 (cohorts born between 1859 and 1879). This period witnessed the halt of the growth experienced by wool-based manufacturing and its subsequent decline in this town. Anthropometric and socio-demographic data are utilized that were compiled from military enlistments held over that period which included more than five thousand young males aged 18-20. Descriptive analyses and multivariate linear regression analysis are conducted. Results illustrate the influence of two components of inequality and poverty in past urban societies during the dynamics of industrialization: income levels and physical environment. For the most part, the peasantry exhibits the lowest height averages. Within this group, those living in the industrial periphery of the town display lower mean statures.
