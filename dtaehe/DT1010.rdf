Title: La economía de Valladolid, 1830-2000. Una perspectiva histórica
Abstract: This paper offers an overview of the modern Economic History of an interior Spanish province (Valladolid). It investigates the reasons of the economic retardation of this central region in contrast with the periphery of the country. It also presents the unknown attempts of the local business class to exploit large industrial conglomerates. The evidence shows that the region did not lack of entrepreneurial spirit. Actually, in spite the adverse agricultural conditions, the Government protection, the little modernisation of its capital market and its large risk aversion, Valladolid became the main industrial district of the region thanks to its specialization in food production and metallurgy
