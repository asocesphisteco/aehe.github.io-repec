Title: Hacia un cártel perfecto. Los acuerdos colusivos en el sector siderúrgico español (1871-1907) 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to analyse the process of cartelisation in the modern Spanish iron and steel industry from the first pricing agreements in 1871 to the creation of the Central Siderúrgica in 1907. Using documentation from archives of iron and steel companies, the article studies the internal operation of the cartels and the difficulties faced in detecting cheating and in avoiding competition from free riders. The work also aims to contribute to the debate on the responsibility of supply within the structure of the Spanish iron and steel market and its influence on the Spanish industrialization.
