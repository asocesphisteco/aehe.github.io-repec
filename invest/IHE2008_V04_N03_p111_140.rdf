Title: Las agencias de informes crediticios en la Argentina: una aproximación al funcionamiento de los mecanismos informativos en el mercado crediticio (1892-c.1935)
Abstract: During the last decades, economic theory has devoted considerable attention to the role of information asymmetry in credit markets and problems connected with this phenomenon. However, institutional aspects —particularly, how information is gathered and shared— have not been studied as thoroughly. Only recently has research been conducted on the origins of credit-reporting agencies and on the different responses lenders designed to minimize the impact of information asymmetries. As far as Latin America is concerned, there is no previous historical research available. In that sense, this paper aims to depict some of the mechanisms used within the Argentine business community at the beginning of the twentieth century to generate and disclose information about borrowers, with particular emphasis on Argentina’s first credit-reporting agencies.
