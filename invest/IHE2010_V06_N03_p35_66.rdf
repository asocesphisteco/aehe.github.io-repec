Title: La participación del bajo clero en el excedente agrario vasco y riojano (1545-1775)
Abstract: This piece of work analyzes the evolution of the agricultural product received by the lower clergy between 1545 and 1775. To establish the annual income received by the parish priest, one must take into account both the quantity and the quantity in kind received as tithe, once all charges and the part set aside for the cathedral had been deducted. In the same way it is necessary to identify the place these priests occupied in the ecclesiastic hierarchy, since their incomes were closely related to this position. In this paper we compare the annual amount received in kind by an average priest and that received by a peasant in the same village. Eventually these figures give us the opportunity to determine how much the maintenance of the local clergy cost the community.
