Title: Protection or Taxation? The Custom Policy of the Iberian Dictatorships on the Cork sector, 1930-1975
Abstract: The central decades of the twentieth century constituted a radical change in the global hegemony of the cork business, ending the Spanish leadership and starting a period of Portuguese cork hegemony that continues today. In this article, customs policy measures followed by the Iberian dictatorships are analyzed and their effects are also assessed in terms of development of cork manufacturing and productive and commercial specialization of Spain and Portugal in the cork business. It is concluded that the differential nature of these measures in both countries, the greater relevance of the business in Portugal, and consequently the greater attention received by the Estado Novo, and also the greater Portuguese success in customs matters, contributed to the achievement of the Portuguese leadership in the cork manufacturing business.
