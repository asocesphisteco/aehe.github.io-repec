Title: The Spanish Tuna Industry in Tropical Waters: From the African Atlantic to the Indian and the Pacific Oceans (1984-2015)
Abstract: The 1980s marked a turning point in the trajectory of the Spanish purse seine tuna freezer industry. Probably the most outstanding aspect was the extension of the fishery to the Western Indian Ocean from 1984. In the Pacific, where it had a presence since the 1970s, the activity was not really significant until the late 1990s. The expansion of the fishery to increasingly distant places, less well known and without connection to the home base ports, required new technological developments and changes in the size of the vessels and the shipping companies. On the other hand, Spain's entry into the EU (1986), the widespread extension of the EEZs to 200 miles (1982), the opening of new markets and the relocation of the canning industry to Asian and Latin American countries, forced to rethink the conditions of entry of the fleet in the different fishing grounds, the negotiating strategies with the coastal countries and the commercial structures of the companies.
