Title: Formación e internacionalización de la gran empresa cárnica española, 1944-2008: Campofrío
Abstract: Campofrío was at 2000 the biggest UE meat processing company and were included between the most important in the world. Just a few manufacturing or food Spanish companies had a similar presence in the European market. This paper wants to looks into the reasons of a short and successfully history. I try to proof that that was the consequence of its managerial and productive virtues and, most of all, its collaboration policy with other Spanish firms which belonged to the same sector. Nevertheless, Campofrío failed in its conquest of Latin America market. Its study could offer a less epic perspective of Spanish companies’ extension in this Continent during the last decades of the 20th century as well as give news references on their growth in West European countries.
