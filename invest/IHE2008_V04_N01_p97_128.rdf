Title: Crisis y reconversión del tejido productivo en un espacio regional del norte de México: La Laguna (1875-1975)
Abstract: The aim of this study is to describe the basic trends of a productive restructure process that took place in northern Mexico in the middle of the 20th century. Supported by a specialized agriculture and by agro-industry since the end of the 19th century, the cotton region known as La Laguna faced a severe transformation process which included: a) new productive methods; b) the reorientation of business activities; c) the introduction of important technological innovations; d) the search for new markets; e) alternative ways of association among producers; and f) a solid institutional presence. Based on these factores, the most important area of dairy production in the country was created in a semi-arid region. This process finally lead to the formation of the most powerful agro alimentary industry in modern Mexico: the LALA group.
