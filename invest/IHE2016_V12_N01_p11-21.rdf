Title: La industria cervecera en Madrid, 1815-1870
Abstract: The end of the monopoly of manufacture, distribution and sale of beer in Madrid in 1791 led to the implementation and development of this industry in the Spanish capital after the end of the War of Independence. The gradual emergence of breweries, mainly by master brewers from German states, led to this sector becomingthe second industry in importance in Madrid behind heavy industry during the eighteen sixties. Also, reducing the distance from the price of beer compared to wine and institutional protection in tax and foreign trade regulations would encourage beer consumption in Madrid to widen its leadership in Spain.
