Title: Meat and Grain Trade in Spain: an Approach from Food Regimes and Food Sovereignty (1950-2023)
Abstract: Since the mid-20th century, Spain’s meat sector has seen remarkable growth, evolving from a net importer to the world’s largest pork exporter by 2020. This work analyzes the drivers behind this transformation within the framework of food regime (FR) theories and the critical lens of food sovereignty movements.

Additionally, we assess the impact on the feed grain sector within the broader context of global food system shifts, concluding with a summary of key insights.
