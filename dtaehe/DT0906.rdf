Title: La formación de un distrito industrial metalúrgico en Valladolid (c. 1842-c. 1953)
Abstract: This work proposes a long term outlook in order to investigate the reasons explaining the development and importance of the metal-mechanic sector in Valladolid during the second half of the 20th century. We find that the political decisions after the Spanish Civil War of 1936 are determinant in explaining the change of size of this industrial district, but also that Valladolid knew how to take advantage of its privileged geographic situation, its means of transport -Canal and Railway-, and the introduction of electric power at the beginning of the century, to free itself from an excessive dependence on the agricultural sector for its development. Not only the political advantages coming out of the war, but also the tradition developed since 1842, explain the introduction of large companies in the next decades.
