Title: Análisis y resultado comparativo del control oficial de flujos en la emigración española a la RFA (1960-1973)
Abstract: This article makes a contribution to Spanish migration to the FRG (1960 1973) using statistical data supplied in both countries in a comparative perspective with other home countries. The aim of this paper is to study the role of institutions in the volume, qualification and gender composition of the migrant population through this case study. Our paper concluded that labour migration to the FRG combined labour market structure of both countries, individual decisions of agents and firms, and a bureaucratic official infrastructure for the management and control of migration flows, which was based on a controlled liberalization of migration policies as well as on a bilateral agreement and on continuous bargaining processes during a growth period.
