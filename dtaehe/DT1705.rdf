Title: The Development of a New Labour Framework during Spain's Second Republic: The Central Office for Placing and Defending against Unemployment 
Abstract: The Great Depression affected the Spanish economy by increasing the number of unemployed workers. With the aim of tackling labor market problems, the Central Office for Placing and Defending against Unemployment was created in 1931 with the aim, in the words of Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, of tackling the «regrettable passion and social or political misadventures». The officials of the Central Placement Office were aware of the proposals of Keynes and other economists on the matter, so it can be said that the implemented employment policies, besides being based on the social urgencies of the moment, tried to find an added legitimacy in the doctrinal currents that then operate under an agreed consensus.
