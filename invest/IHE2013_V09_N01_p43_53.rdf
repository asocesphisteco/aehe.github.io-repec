Title: El impacto a largo plazo de la política industrial del desarrollismo español
Abstract: This paper assesses the mid-to-long-term impact of regional development policies during Franco's dictatorship, particularly the growth poles between 1964 to 1975. Criticized by economists, most of the arguments against relied on a short-term perspective, when the first oil crisis hit the Spanish economy. We first examine the Spanish experience set against the background of Western European dynamics; we then summarize the nature and main consequences of the industrial policies and their regional impact; and finally, we evaluate the effect of growth poles on the industrial growth of those provinces where this instrument of economic policy was applied.
