Title: Política demográfica, crecimiento económico y formación del mercado laboral en el Perú del siglo veinte
Abstract: This article presents the local determinants of the politics of population and of the demographic evolution from Peru along the twentieth century. For it exposes the process of formation of the labor market, in the context of a country in which to nineteenth-century ends three quarters of the population lived immersed in an auto subsistence regimen, and whose commercial sector consisted of primary economies of export disseminated by the territory of the republic. Inside the Latin- American world, Peru was characterized, first, by its high birth rates and by having a well latest start of its demographic transition, and second, by the rapid decrease of its birth rate. This work tries to explain so much the origins as the economic consequences of this path.
