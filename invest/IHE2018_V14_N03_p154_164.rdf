Title: Importaciones y comercialización de los vinos del Marco de Jerez en Estados Unidos (1791-1824)
Abstract: At the end of the 18th century and in the first decades of the 19th century the exports of wines from the area of Jerez de la Frontera were directed mainly at the British and colonial market, as well as to the former territory of the new independent thirteen colonies, which became a major consumer. This article intends to show the evolution of the American imports of wines from the Marco de Jerez by re-analysing the statistics published by private individuals and by the US Treasury Department, and also using the records of the Philadelphia Custom House, as well as the communication media of the time. These data are a relevant contribution, as there was no evidence of the importance of this market for the wines of the Marco de Jerez, and even more so as the statistics of exports of such wines are not available for that period of time.
