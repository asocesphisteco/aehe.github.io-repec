Title: Causas de la restricción eléctrica en el primer franquismo: una aportación desde la historia empresarial
Abstract: Our work has two goals. The first and most important is to propose a new cause of electrical restrictions suffered during the forties, consisting of the pact signed in 1934-36 between Saltos del Duero and hydroelectric group. Because of this agreement, Saltos del Duero was converted in the dominant producer in two areas of Spain, the centre and north-northwest, which turned Duero in the main decision-maker in terms of new construction. Such a pact meant a radical conflict of interests between Duero, who wanted to moderate their investments, and hydroelectric group, eager to have abundant energy. The managers of Duero, dominated by the problems and the mentality of the thirties, when the problem was lack of demand, hindered the supply response. Finally, the second goal is to show our doubts about the relevance of low tariffs in the investment decisions.
