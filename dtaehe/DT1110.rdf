Title: La transición demográfica en Japón, Corea del Sur y China: un análisis comparado
Abstract:  A comparative analysis of the Demographic Transition in China, Japan and South Korea is offered, aimed at identifying the peculiarities and common denominators of this proc-ess in these countries. The context within which these countries have developed the Demographic Transition has conditioned the pace and speed of the process. The causes and consequences of the recent decline in fertility rates to extremely low levels in these countries are also explored. These demographic changes have induced social and economic transformations, which are examined, and the extent to which these countries can be considered characteristic of the Second Demographic Transition is discussed as well.  Finally, the impact of the demographic dividend on the recent economic growth of these countries is also analyzed, and the possible consequences of demographic aging for their future are explored.
