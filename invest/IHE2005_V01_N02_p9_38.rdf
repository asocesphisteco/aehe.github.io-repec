Title: Una estimación del crecimiento económico en la Edad Moderna 
Abstract: The paper discusses different attempts to measure economic growth in Europe before the Industrial Revolution. It is argued that the figures published by Angus Maddison probably overestimate growth between 1000 and 1820. Next, a method for simulating long-term patterns of growth is presented, and the results of this experiment, i.e. annual time series for the most important European countries, are discussed. It is concluded that growth was very slow between c 1450 and c 1800 —with the notable exceptions of England and the Netherlands— and that between c 1000 and c 1450, GDP per capita increased probably faster than in the centuries before the Industrial Revolution.
