Title: Un Zaibatsu fuera de lugar: los orígenes del Grupo Fierro (1870?1939)
Abstract: This work is focused on the origins and starting of Fierro’s Group. Ildefonso Fierro (1882?1961) was one of the most prominent businessmen of Franco’s Regime. Fierro’s case study presents two features that distinguish it from other Spanish family firms born in the first half of the twentieth century: its high degree of diversification and its peculiar financial history.

This article analyzes how he achieved it and compares its path with that of the Japanese Zaibatsu (paper text in Spanish)
