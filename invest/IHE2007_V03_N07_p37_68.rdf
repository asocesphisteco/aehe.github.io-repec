Title: El poder de compra de jornaleros y criados. Salarios reales y mercados de trabajo en la Navarra rural, 1781-1936
Abstract: This article presents new estimates of the cost of living and real wages in the agriculture from 1781 to 1936 in Southern Navarre. The typology of wages includes male labourers, female labourers and servants. The calculated indexes suggest that the rural standard of living increased after the Napoleonic Wars, stagnated and dropped along the 19th century, and rose again in the 20th century. Anyway, servants and labourers experienced remarkable differences in their living standard paths.
