Title: Redes en la génesis y desarrollo de un distrito papelero catalán: el caso de Capellades (siglo XIX)
Abstract: The area of Capellades (Barcelona), together with the Alcoy one, led the Spanish papermaking manufacture growth during the eighteenth century. Later on, during the mechanization process of the nineteenth century, this area did not adopt the continuous fabrication technique and went on making paper by hand. This decision was not guided by atavism. Such a technological option was an answer to its productive specialization (quality paper and cigarette paper) which could still benefit from a substantial demand. This technological model, which was not static, was successful thanks to the district dynamics and the establishment of a dense network for raw materials supply and for paper commercialisation. Without taking into account all these factors, it is very difficult to understand why very small firms have survived until the present and have been even able to hold leading positions in some paper markets.
