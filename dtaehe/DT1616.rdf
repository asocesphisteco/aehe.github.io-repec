Title: Political Regime and Social Spending in Spain: A Time Series Analysis(1850-2000)
Abstract: In the last 150 years, Spain has had a turbulent political history. What has been the impact on social policy? Democracy had a positive effect on both the levels and the long-run trend of social spending. In fact, the transition from a traditional regime (with low social spending levels) to a modern regime (with high social spending levels) started with the advent of democracy in 1931. Franco’s dictatorship, however, reversed this trend change, leading to a delay in the definitive growth of social spending in Spain. At the same time, the effect of left-wing parties was statistical significant only in the 30s (before the Keynesian consensus) and during the Restoration period (when the preferences of the lower income groups were systematically ignored).
