Title: Empresariado, Iglesia y ahorro popular: las cajas de ahorro y Montes de Piedad de Castilla y León, 1841-2013
Abstract: This paper makes an effort to analyze the evolution of the Castilla Leon savings banks from their founding up to the 2008 crisis. It is an attempt to precisely identify the historical causes that led these institutions to a situation of complete insolvency. The text argues that their submission to public authorities, who forced their profits to be used to meet the social investment needs of the State itself, excessive exposure to the real estate business and the war waged from 1990 onwards to capture deposits, all led these institutions to bankruptcy. Furthermore, the article shows the very different conception these entities had in the eyes of the Church and civil society, an aspect neglected in the Economic History of Spain.
