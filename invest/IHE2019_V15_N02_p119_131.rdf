Title: The impact of World War II on nutrition and children’s health in Italy
Abstract: The impact of World War II on the nutrition and health of Italian children is examined. During the Second World War (1939–1945), both per capita GDP and consumption collapsed in Italy. Infant mortality increased. The anthropometric measurements of a sample of schoolchildren show a loss in weight and height in comparison with the pre-war years. Measurements of conscripts born during the conflict show an interruption in the secular increase in height, with a decrease in the mean height of conscripts born in 1945. The adverse impact of the war on height, particularly affected the northern regions, and appears to be related to the ‘geography of conflict’ in Italy.
