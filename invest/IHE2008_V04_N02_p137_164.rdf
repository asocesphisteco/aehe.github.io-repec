Title: ¿Proyecto faraónico o chivo expiatorio? La IV Planta Siderúrgica Integral de Sagunto (1966-1977) 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to analyse the reasons for the creation of the Fourth Integrated Steel Plant in Sagunto. Using primary sources, we demonstrate that it was a rational decision that imitated the experience of other developed countries. This decision was based on a market study that failed in its steel consumption forecast. But such error was not due to the imperial dreams of Franco’s regime, but to the unforeseeable character of the 1970’s economic crisis and its effects on the steel industry.
