Title: Catedráticos in the making of the Spanish Secondary Education System, 1861-1885
Abstract: This article provides an overview of the body of secondary education catedráticos in 19th century Spain using the Escalafón General de Catedráticos de Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza of years 1861, 1876 and 1885. This new database of more than 1600 individuals allows us to carry out a detailed analysis of the total number of teachers, their years of experience, the subjects they taught and how they were distributed among the different provinces. Beyond the increase in the number of members, the consolidation of this body of teachers was characterized both by its progressive transformation into an elite body of public servants, and by a close relationship with the economic reality of the country.
