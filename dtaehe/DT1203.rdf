Title: Las raíces agrarias del crecimiento económico andaluz y el grupo Larios (1800-1936)
Abstract: This article tries to shed light on a macroeconomic issue from a microeconomic or business perspective. The problem is the Andalusian backwardness in comparison to more advantaged regions of Spain and the subsequent negative effects it had on the population’s standard of living. The backwardness was due to the overemphasis on activities related to the production and transformation of agricultural products in the region during the 19th century and the first third of the 20th century, a period when the opposite just should have occurred. The business perspective is based on a case study of the Larios Group, which was an engine of economic changes in the region along this period. An important feature of this evolution was the increase of the agrarian share of their business, especially in their industrial activities. The epilogue suggests a hypothesis trying to explain why this agrarian orientation, given the socio-political context of the region, allowed for economic growth but blocked structural change.(Full text in Spanish)
