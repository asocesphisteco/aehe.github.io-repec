Title: For a Multidimensional Measure of Land Inequality in 1930s Italy. A Historical-Statistical Analysis
Abstract: In this study, land inequality in Italy during fascism was observed and reconstructed in order to offer new elements of analysis related to the study of inequality in the Italian countryside during the first half of the twentieth century. Using provincial data of the 1930Agricultural Census, five indicators of land inequality were constructed. Initially, a univariate analysis was carried out, taking the indicators individually; subsequently, using a multivariate approach, three synthetic indicators were produced. Finally, the provinces were divided into homogeneous clusters based on the concentration of land ownership. A notable useful tool for analysis was mapping using GIS software.
