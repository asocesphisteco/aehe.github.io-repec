Title: Commons For Sale. Economic And Institutional Change In Nineteenth Century Northern Spain
Abstract:  This study examines a facet of institutional change in 19th Century Spain. Empirical analysis of a zone in the Ebro valley confirms that the process of selling commons prior to the 1855 Ley de Desamortización (Disentailment Law) was of great significance. It evaluates the nature of the changes in property rights and identifies the main social protagonists of the era, with the aim of analysing the repercussions these had on production and on the distribution of agrarian income
