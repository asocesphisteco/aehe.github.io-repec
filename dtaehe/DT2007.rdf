Title: Son Preference, Gender Discrimination and Missing Girls in Rural Spain, 1750-1950
Abstract: Relying on longitudinal micro data from a Spanish rural region between 1750 and 1950 (almost 35,000 life courses), this article evidences that discriminatory practices affected sex-specific mortality during infancy and childhood. Although it is likely that families also discriminated girls during the first year of life, the female excess mortality was especially visible in the 1-5 age-group. In this regard, while breastfeeding seemed to have temporarily mitigated the effects of gender discrimination, sex-specific mortality rates behaved markedly different once children were weaned. Parents therefore prioritised boys during infancy and childhood in the allocation of food and/or care in order to enhance their survival chances.
