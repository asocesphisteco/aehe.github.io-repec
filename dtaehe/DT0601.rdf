Title: El Mercado De Función Empresarial
Abstract:  This work starts from the conceptual and theoretical world developed by Schumpeter, to advance in the study of the financing of innovations, i.e. the relationship between capital and the entrepreneur. It establishes the fundamental proposition that the function of the entrepreneur is susceptible to being commercialised, and agreement on its price is much more complex than the fixing of interest rates. This fundamental proposition guides our steps towards other propositions naturally derived from it and relating to corporate entrepreneurship, strategic management, venture capital, the agency theory and family companies, in order to demonstrate its possible utility as a new theoretical tool for the understanding of the complex phenomena around these and other research issues. This allows us to bring together areas of study that are not usually considered together, i.e. the above areas in the broad area of business organisation, and economic history, in short business history.
