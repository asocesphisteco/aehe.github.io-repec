Title: Autarquía y atraso tecnológico en la industria textil española, 1939-1959  
Abstract: This paper analyzes the effect of Franco's autarchic policy (1939-1959) on the delay in the technological advance of the Spanish textile industry. The study is based on official data from patents, textile machinery imports, and various comparative estimates on the efficiency of the textile industry. It was found that some of textile machinery produced in Spain was introduced, that partially covered the shortage of imported machinery. But, when international technology transfer was interrupted, it was not possible to advance towards a complete replacement of the technology in the textile machinery industry. Based on new empirical evidence, it concludes that the autarchic period not only had a negative impact on the technological development of the Spanish textile industry, but it also led to a genuine regression in international terms.
