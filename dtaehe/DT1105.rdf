Title: La maraña intervencionista franquista en el fomento de la exportación. el « dumping corchero»
Abstract:  The main objective of this work is to analyze the measures implemented during the Franco dictatorship over the period 1939?1959 to revive the exports of cork products, which had fallen sharply since the beginning of the crisis of 1929. The first measure, implemented in 1939 and 1940, was granting tax reliefs to exporters of several cork products; its impact on commercial traffic of cork was very low. The second measure was the establishment, between 1946 and 1950, of a subsidies system for cork exports, which allowed the recovery of the Spanish cork exports. Yet, these were classified as dumping by the United States and created a trade conflict, which forced its repeal. Immediately after this repeal, cork products were incorporated into the multiple exchange rates mechanism in force in Spain since 1948, a system of hidden subsidies that allowed an improvement in cork exports during the 1950's. The work also examines whether the objective of protecting domestic industry, through the promotion of cork manufactures exports, was limited by the need of obtaining foreign exchange from exports. The incentives that the dictatorship applied for the export of raw cork that was in turn needed by the industry to work with, seems to point to such limit. (Main text in Spanish)
