Title: Una aproximación a la intensidad industrial vasca: la industria guipuzcoana en 1860
Abstract: The main aim of this article is to show the degree of industrialization of the Basque Country, and especially of Gipuzkoa, in 1860, comparing it with the remainder of Spain. The industrial structure, its location and the weight of different sectors are shown analysing the taxes of the workshops and factories in 1860 and comparing it with the structure of industry of Spain deduced of the industrial contribution in 1856. A dispersed industry dominates Gipuzkoa and many of its main centres are situated in the inland. The weight of the modern sectors developed from 1841 is also highlighted, with an estimated quota of up to 51% of all the manufacturing establishments. It is suggested that the Basque industry of that time has been undervalued and that the industrial intensity of the Basque Country was two and a half times the average of Spain in 1860.
