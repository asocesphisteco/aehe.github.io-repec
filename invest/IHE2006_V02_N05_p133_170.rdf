Title: Geografía y desigualdad económica y demográfica de las provincias españolas (siglos XIX y XX)
Abstract: This article deals with the economic and demographic inequalities within the Spanish provinces from the 19th to the 20th centuries. It draws attention to the striking differences existing not so much in terms of per-capita product, which are also important even now, but specially in terms of territorial extension, product, population, economic density, and economic population and it compares the situations prevalent in the years 1955 and 2000. The interprovincial and interregional inequalities in contemporary Spain are examined with regard to other Mediterranean countries. As far as Spain is concerned, it intends to take an exclusively geographical approach, which is econometrically tested. It leads to the conclusion that geography counts, and for much, in the explanation of the dramatic economic and demographic inequalities that are observed across Spanish provinces, at least, from the late 18th century.
