Title: Protección e importaciones de madera en España (1880-1935)
Abstract: This work analyses Spanish imports of rough and manufactured timber between 1880 and 1935. We start by measuring the percentage of both over Spanish wood consumption, showing the continuity of the former and the fall of the latter. Then an annual series of tariffs applicable to these products is built in order to estimate, through two different econometric models, protection effects on import evolution. According to our results, these effects were moderate. The different behaviour of rough and manufactured timber, therefore, may be explained by differences in their competitiveness, which is related to Spanish timber resources and to the integration of the domestic timber market.
