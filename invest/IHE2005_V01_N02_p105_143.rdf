Title: El grado de discriminación salarial de las mujeres en España, 1930: una primera aproximación
Abstract: Many studies have shown the existence of discrimination against women during Spanish industrialization. Discrimination may have occurred in the form of pre-market discrimination, such as industrial segregation, or through wage discrimination in the labour market. The aim of this article is to estimate empirically the degree of wage discrimination. The main findings suggest that discrimination could have been high.
Because of the lack of better data, the result should be considered, however, as a first attempt to quantify discrimination.
