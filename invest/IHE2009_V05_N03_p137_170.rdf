Title: Actividades y estrategias económicas de la burguesía alicantina en los años cuarenta del siglo XIX
Abstract: In this text we analyze the main economic activities that were developed in the city of Alicante in the mid 19th century promoted by dynamic elite of aristocrats and middle classes. The economy was moderately diversified, the main weight falling on trade and commercial farming. Following this we
examine the economic strategies of these elites who pursued the creating of a state of opinion in order to influence the authorities to put into practice economic development policies for agriculture and free trade.
