Title: Blanco White y las cuestiones econo?micas
Abstract:  Between the  end  of  the  Enlightenment  and  the  incipient  liberalism,  Blanco  White  was  one  of  the  most  important  Spanish  intellectuals  of  the  first  half  of  the  nineteenth  century.  His  exile  in  England (1810)1841) and his mastery of the English language enabled him to relate to some of the  great British economists and thinkers of the era, such as Malthus, Bentham, Whately, Senior or J.S.  Mill.  Despite  this  and  his  initial  training  in  the  business  world,  Blanco  White  never  paid  particular  attention  to  socioeconomic  issues.  In  fact,  he  has  been  primarily  studied  as  political  writer,  journalist,  man  of  letters  or  religious  polemicist.  However,  he  also  addressed  some  issues  of  undoubted  economic  interest,  as  the  slave  trade,  the  situation  of  Spain  in  the  early  nineteenth  century, the problem of the poor, or the colonial question and the overseas trade. This paper aims  to  examine  how  Blanco  White  approached  these  issues  within  the  context  of  the  ideas  of  his  Spanish contemporaries. It also aims to show that Blanco’s ideas were largely rooted in a Spanish  tradition of thought (full text in Spanish)
