Title: Why wheat? International patterns of wheat demand, 1939–2010
Abstract: Almost half the calories consumed globally today derive directly from grain; of this, about a quarter comes from wheat. Thanks to international trade, wheat is widely consumed in places where its production is virtually impossible, thus making the functioning of wheat markets unique in its importance for world food security. Yet it was not always like that: in historical terms, the globalization of wheat consumption has been a relatively new phenomenon. The aim of this work is twofold. First, it identifies major trends in wheat consumption across different groups of countries from 1939 to 2010. Second, it offers an informed explanation of those trends.
