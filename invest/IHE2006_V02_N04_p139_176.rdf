Title: La evolución de la industria harinera en España durante el siglo XX
Abstract: This work analyses the evolution of the flour industry in Spain during the twentieth century. Unlike other food industries, the flour industry has decreased, especially in the last decades of the twentieth century, due to its low income elasticity. This work identifies four main characteristics of the growth of the flour industry from the years following the WWI until the last decades of the century: 1) the productive grew more rapidly than the production and the consumption; 2) the industry was composed of small establishments and firms which were maintained while the industry underwent a process of modernization towards the creation of bigger entities; 3) increasing state regulation; and 4) a process of convergence between the location of the flour industry and the wheat production areas due to the weight of the raw material in the total productive costs.
