Title: La integración del reino nazarí de Granada en el espacio comercial europeo (siglos XIII-XV)
Abstract: There is no doubt about the presence of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada in the mercantile platform of Europe. Various indicators support that: different foreign mercantile communities worked in the area; the most important European races activated here sophisticated financial and mercantile technologies; the Nasrid ports were opened for the maritime international traffic; and lastly, Nasrid commodities could be found in the most important European markets. This integration of the Nasrid kingdom took place in a widespread context of economic development in Occident, generated a strong dinamization of the commercial activity and meant a reorientation of its socio-economic structure. Overcome this general approach, up to the moment however has been complex to identify the guidelines of that evolution. This research extensively based on a new and splendid data —the accounting deprived of Genovese merchants active in Granada between 1435 and 1455—, constituted a first approach to these topics.
