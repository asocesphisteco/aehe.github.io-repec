Title: Una creciente desigualdad. La propiedad de la tierra en Buenos Aires entre 1839 y 1855
Abstract: This article studies the evolution in land property distribution in the rural sector of Buenos Aires between the central years of Rosas government and the beginning of the liberal era, employing as its principal sources some economic censuses taken for fiscal purposes and some population lists. We observe a global increase in inequality that may be associated with the limitations in land availability alongside an important demographic growth. But we also find significant regional differences that can be explained by a number of reasons among which are the productive profile, the initial conditions of population density and land distribution, and the urbanization process, among others.
