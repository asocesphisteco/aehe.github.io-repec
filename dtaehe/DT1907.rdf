Title: The First Business Schools and the Corporate Elite in Spain (1958-2000)
Abstract: Literature has highlighted the key role of business schools in spreading US management in Europe after the Second World War, but has not found
how to quantify its impact on the economy. With such purpose, this article examines the relations between the two main Spanish private business schools, 
IESE and ESADE, and the national corporate elite. By combining an institutional approach and social networks analysis, it shows the incidence of business 
schools on the board of directors of the largest Spanish corporations during the second half of the 20th century, and explains their role as centers for
elite reproduction.
