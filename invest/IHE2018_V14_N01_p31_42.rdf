Title: Mercado internacional, mercado nacional: el bacalao en España en el primer tercio del siglo XX
Abstract: This paper attempts to shed light on the market performance for dried and salted cod in Spain throughout the first third of the twentieth century. Cod was produced almost exclusively for sale on the international market, and Spain was traditionally the largest buyer. The paper is organised into three blocks. First —sections 1 to 3—, an analysis is made of the Spanish imports of cod and changes in their source of origin, relating them to the evolution of international production and Spanish trade policy, as well as the launch of domestic production, with its effects on imports. Secondly —sections 4 and 5—, a study is made of the domestic market and its coordination, paying attention to those elements that have favoured integration. The third part —section 6— examines the role played by the different qualities of the cod and its relevance from the point of view of market size and competitiveness of producers.
