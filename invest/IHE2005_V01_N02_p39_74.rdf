Title: El mercado de factores en la agricultura murciana durante el siglo XIX
Abstract: The focus of this paper is to shed light about the argument in favour of an influence of a production resources endowment with different intensity on the economic growth model of Murcia. This paper has been structured in three parts, to present the characteristics and evolution of earth, labour and capital supply and demand in the 19th century. Attention has been mainly paid to the importance of environmental factors, a growing demographic density, a rural process tendency and the agrarian structures for the mentioned resources evolution. For the effects of agrarian structures the main analysed factor has been the dominance of indirect management based on small farms. According to the main conclusions, the mentioned factors were acting through particular mechanisms to guide the resources interaction and the economic agents’ strategies..
