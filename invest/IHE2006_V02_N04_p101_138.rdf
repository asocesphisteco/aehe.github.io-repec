Title: Salarios y Programas de Bienestar Industrial en la empresa ferroviaria MZA (1915-1935)
Abstract: We analyse in this paper the evolution of wages and salaries, in real and monetary terms, of permanent staff in the railway company MZA during the so-called “Railway Problem” period. Their understanding would not be complete without taking into account Industrial Social Welfare programmes, since these accounted for a high percentage of earnings. One of the main conclusions of this paper is that, during the period examined, the real income of railway employees improved and wage differentials between the various levels narrowed, although such levels continued to be very high.
