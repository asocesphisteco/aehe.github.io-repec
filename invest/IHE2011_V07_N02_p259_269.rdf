Title: Geografía de la cera en España y Francia, 1750-1850
Abstract: The aim of traditional beekeeping was to produce wax, an expensive raw material used at church ceremonies and for the lighting of upper-class houses. Between 1750 and 1850, the Atlantic Landes and the Mediterranean mountains of France and Spain were unable to satisfy a growing demand, and both countries had to import wax from Northern Europe and the Middle East. Thus a commercial axis of short, middle and long distance connected the producing areas to the centres of wax whitening, candle making and distribution, such as was the case of the French town of Limoges.
