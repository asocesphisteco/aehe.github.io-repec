Title: The poverty of Boldizzoni: Resurrecting the German Historical School 
Abstract: Boldizzoni's attack on cliometrics is unpersuasive, in part because he does not grasp economics and its uses, in part because he admires uncritically the German Historical School and their modern descendants, the French Annalistes. Much is to be learned from the earlier schools, but not by throwing away the insights that economics gives into how an economy holds together.
