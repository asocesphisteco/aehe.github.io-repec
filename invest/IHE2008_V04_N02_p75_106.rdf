Title: Avances y límites de la expansión agraria argentina: crecimiento económico y distribución de la riqueza rural en Entre Ríos (1860-1892)
Abstract: This article deals with the economic growth and the wealth-distribution changes of an Argentine province during the second half of the 19th century. This case is particularly relevant since the fast agrarian development that characterised most Argentine provinces during that period was, by contrast, much more difficult and slower there. That poor progress, as well as a persisting strongly unequal wealth distribution, is explained by complex economic and institutional processes, closely related to changing internal boundaries, such as how new territories were exploited according to their environmental conditions and to their age as new settlements. Even though personal revenue was not radically altered, medium proprietors, however, expanded through the period his share on total wealth against more affluent groups.
