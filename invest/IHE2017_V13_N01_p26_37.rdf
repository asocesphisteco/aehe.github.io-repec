Title: Auge, quiebra y reconversión de la industria de electrodomésticos en España a la luz del Grupo Orbaiceta SA, c. 1950-1990
Abstract: This article uses a case study to explore the birth and deployment of the household appliance sector in Spain during the country's major economic development between 1960 and 1975. On the back of this growth cycle, Orbaiceta SA became one of Spain's most dynamic and innovative firms. Brand reputation was achieved through the reinvestment of profits and aggressive market penetration. Once it had consolidated its position as the domestic market leader, the company launched an internationalisation strategy. It took over plants in financial difficulties, albeit with a high technological content. One fifth of its production was sold abroad. However, this expansion failed due to the economic crisis of the 1970s and early 1980s, exacerbated by the political uncertainty of the period of transition from Franco's dictatorship to democracy. Over-borrowing bankrupted the Group, which was bailed out with public funds. Following a process of industrial restructuring, the company was sold to the German multinational BSH.
