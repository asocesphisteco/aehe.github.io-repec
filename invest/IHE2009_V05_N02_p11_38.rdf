Title: Teorías del valor y la función empresarial
Abstract: This article studies the theories of value, economic growth and entrepreneurship of three relevant authors, David Hume, Adam Smith and Jeremy Bentham. Utilitarianism and their different conceptions of time are the basis for different theories, which are even represented by different main characters. The three economic theories are original and theoretically innovative and we may use them as three different economic models.
