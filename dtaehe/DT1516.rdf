Title: The Spanish modern economic growth from an environmental perspective. A state of the art 
Abstract:  This work introduces some concepts, tools and works useful to analyse modern economic growth in Spain in historical perspective, taking into account some of its environmental aspects. The paper is based on the idea, supported by ecological economics, that the economy is and has been historically an open subsystem constantly interacting with society and ecosystems. In this general framework we review the main works analysing Spanish economic history matters from this specific perspective or friendly points of view. We believe that this approach to economic history is convenient for bringing to light some aspects and problems that usually remind hidden in the main stream of economic history analysis, and is, therefore, helpful for a better understanding of historical economic growth and economic development and its consequences.
