Title: Globalización, expansión de la frontera y desigualdad en Chile durante el auge salitrero (1880-1905)
Abstract: The literature on Latin American inequality during the First Globalization inspired by the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model suggests that inequality rose because of specialization in natural resource-intensive goods. However, this line of research has been criticized because of the simplifications and assumptions of the model. In this paper we argue that even in a neoclassical framework it must be revised in the light of changes in relative factor endowments, such as the expansion of the frontier —a common process in that period. Using a set of new estimates of income inequality in Chile between 1880 and 1905, we show that the expansion of the frontier opened up a process of social change and labor force migrations which improved the income distribution.
