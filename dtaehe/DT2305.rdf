Title: Missing females: how many, where, when, causes and consequences
Abstract: The objective of this essay is to explore the present and future figures, geographic distribution, underlying causes, and consequences of the missing females phenomenon. Leveraging data on fertility and sex ratios of international organizations (the United Nations and the World Bank) and employing an  analysis of secondary sources, this study draws the following key conclusions: 1) The global number of missing women equaled or exceeded 100 million by 1990 and has continued to rise since then, projected to reach 150 million by 2035; 2) China and India together account for more than 80% of the global missing females; 3) The prevalence of selective abortions of female fetuses surged in societies marked by rigid patrilineal and patrilocal traditions after a decline in fertility rates and the proliferation of ultrasound technology, thereby leading to a reduction in the number of postnatal sex-selective individuals; 4) Eastern Asia has experienced a demographic dividend, yet its economic growth has been hampered in the past decade due to the relative expansion of the dependent population; 5) Skewed sex ratios, that are anticipated to persist, have resulted in a masculinization of the adult population, with a lag of approximately one and a half decades,  causing disruptions in the marriage market. This poses a significant threat to social stability in several countries, particularly in China.
