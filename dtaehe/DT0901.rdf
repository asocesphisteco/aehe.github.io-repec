Title: Coste de la vida y salarios en Madrid, 1680-1800 
Abstract: The presentation and analysis of a cost of living index and of different wage indices for   the city of Madrid, covering the period 1680-1800 is the essential aim of this article. The   accounts  books  of  several  charitable  institutions  have  been  the  basic  source  of   information for this research. The main conclusions of the work are as follows: 1) in the   eighteenth century the evolution of prices in Madrid was quite similar to those in most   western and central European cities; 2) yearly fluctuations in the cost of living were   lower in Madrid than Palencia, Toledo and Seville; 3) in the second half of that century,   Madrid was one of the cities of the old continent which showed the most abrupt fall in   the wages of unskilled workers; 4) during the eighteenth century, the ‚'skill premium'   increased quite noticeably in the Madrid service sector; and 5) the wage differential   between men and women fell in that century, due, probably, to the considerable raise   in the weight of female work in the important domestic service sector in Madrid
