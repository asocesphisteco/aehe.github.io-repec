Title: La inversión en equipo de transporte de América Latina, 1890-1930: una estimación basada en la demanda de importaciones
Abstract: The development of modern transport systems over the first economic globalisation has been recognised as a key instrument for inserting Latin-America into the international economy. However, to this date, there was no quantitative global and detailed evaluation of the amounts invested on transport equipment in the region. This article covers this gap supplying homogeneous and consistent annual series for the period 1890-1930 for all the sovereign countries of the time. It also describes the historical profile of the Latin-American series and analyses the differences across the national series. The large disparities in the levels of investment per capita observed reflect the diverse degree of economic development attained by the Latin- American republics over the period.
