Title: La regulación industrial y la transferencia internacional de tecnología en España (1959-1973)
Abstract: This work analyses the relationship between technological change, firm size and market structure, applied to the Spanish economy during 1959-1973. Despite the voluminous literature, the theory yields ambiguous predictions about the effect of market concentration on innovative activity. My results support Schumpeter’s hypothesis that innovation increases with market concentration. This empirical work has also found that other variables, such as the extent of product differentiation, can affect innovative activity.
