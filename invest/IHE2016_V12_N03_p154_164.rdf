Title: Obstáculos comerciales y salariales a la transición nutricional en la España de comienzos del siglo xx
Abstract: The characteristics of the internal market trading networks, the foreign trade policy and the low wage levels were some of the circumstances that determined the access to food in the Spanish cities at the beginning of the 20th century. For the impact of the trade policy, the prices in the major peninsular cities in 1909-1913 are compared with the prices of Gibraltar and with some of the main cities round the world, such as Madrid in1925. To assess the effects of the trade problems, the prices of each Spanish city in 1909-1913 are compared with the one combined with the minimum prices of all of them. The possibilities of accessing the consumption patterns of each city in 1964-1965 are compared with the prices and wages in the years before the First World War.
