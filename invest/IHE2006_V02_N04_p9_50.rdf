Title: El nivel de vida en la España atrasada entre 1800 y 1936. El caso de Palencia
Abstract: New estimates of cost of living and real wages from 1800 to the Civil War are presented in this article. Both prices and bricklayers’ wages have been obtained from a Palencia’s hospital records. The indexes calculated suggest that the standard of living deteriorated during the central decades of the 19th century. Only during the first third of the 20th century real wages increased, but less than in Western Europe.
Demographic, anthropometric and social data reveal the same conclusions.
