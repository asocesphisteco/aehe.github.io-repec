Title: Los flujos de información en las redes comerciales castellanas de los siglos XV y XVI
Abstract: This article analyzes the information flows in Castilian commercial networks developed during the 15th and 16th centuries and points out that having an efficient system of news distribution contributed to having a better business performance since it lowered transaction costs. These flows have been studied in three different places: the Burgos Consulate, the Burgos maritime insurance and Simon Ruiz’s company. Thousands of different documents (commercial correspondence, public notary documents and accounting books) have been kept from these three sources, thus allowing us calculating information costs as well as data velocity of distribution and its geographical dispersion. Our study concluded that the aforementioned commercial networks were formed by companies which have developed very efficient management systems.
