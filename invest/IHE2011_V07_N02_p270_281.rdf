Title: Modernización en el sector industrial arrocero en Michoacán, México. Legado empresarial italiano de inicios del siglo XX
Abstract: The aim of this work is to revise the contribution made in the field of improvement on agro-industrial methods in rice-refining crops which was carried out by a group of Italian immigrants, the Cusi family, who arrived at the so called Tierra Caliente of Michoacán (central west of Mexico) at the end of 19th century. This contribution was most marked in the context of the modernization project of Porfirio Diaz's government (1877-1911). In order to underline this contribution, reference has been made to the striking growth observed in production levels of rice crops and the methods used to refine them before and after the arrival of these agricultural entrepreneurs. Henceforth, rice-refining was transformed from being an isolated working activity carried out by hand into another one which had the definite character of an agro-industry, due to its labour organization, the kind of energy sources it used, and above all, the systematic character of its processes.
