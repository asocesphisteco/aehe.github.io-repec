Title: Industrialización, desarrollo financiero y oferta monetaria en Barcelona a mediados del siglo XIX
Abstract: The article deals with the need, inherent in any process of industrialization, to increase money supply in order to avoid deflationary tensions. We examine the case of a major financial and commercial centre: Barcelona in the mid-nineteenth century. The paper specifies the volume of different types of fiat money in circulation (bank notes, “validated” cheques, internal pay orders, short-term bonds…) and their characteristics as means of payment. The aim of the study is to show that, in a context of “free banking” without legal tender of the paper money, there was an automatic process towards a balance between supply and demand for money and that any possible oversupply was eliminated through a “crowding out” effect. In such systems, money-supply growth seems have not significant effects on prices, but instead, sudden contractions of money supply did have intense upward impacts on interest rate.
