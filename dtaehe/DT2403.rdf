Title: A Note on the Reception and Influence of H. C. Carey in Spain
Abstract: In contrast to Ricardo and Malthus's class-conflict economy, H.C. Carey (1793-1879) proposed an economic model of social harmony where capitalists and workers could progress together without conflicts. Later, upon observing that economic growth in the United States had been much higher during protectionist stages, he sought to understand the reasons behind it, reformulating protectionism with new arguments. His influence in Europe was intense but short-lived. In Spain, overshadowed by Bastiat's optimism, whom he accused of plagiarizing his ideas, little of his model of social harmony was adopted. However, during years of intense debate between protectionists and free traders, his protectionism was highly influential, especially within Catalan business organizations.
