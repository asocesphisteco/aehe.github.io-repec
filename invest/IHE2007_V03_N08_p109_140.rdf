Title: Empresas autónomas y grupos de inversión. Las empresas del grupo Morrison en Rosario, Argentina (1890-1930)
Abstract: In order to think over the historiographical debate of the decreasing profitability of the British investments in Argentina from the first postwar period onwards, the performance of two English public utility companies in Rosario are analyzed from the beginning of their activities, at the end of the 19th century, up to 1930: The Rosario Waterworks Company and the Rosario City Improvements. The two companies were under control of the same investment group (Morrison), however their performances diverged. Throughout the analysis of the accounting data, we examine the firms’ management and the elements that influenced their revenues and profitability: waterworks and sewerage utilities production conditions and demand, the relationship with authorities according to the concession terms, and the managerial strategies in changing domestic and international capital markets.
