Title: Antonio de Miguel: Informal Journalist of the Francoist Economy
Abstract: Antonio de Miguel appears in the foot notes of the Spanish economic history books as the author of one of the national income estimations prior to those made from 1944 by the Consejo de Economía Nacional. However, his work as a statistician and economist went much further. In particular, his work as an informal economic journalist during Franco’s dictatorship is of special interest. This study focuses on it, although it also considers the rest of his economic work.
