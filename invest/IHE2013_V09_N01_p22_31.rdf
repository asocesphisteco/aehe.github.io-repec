Title: Empresa e innovación tecnológica en el distrito industrial de Manresa durante el franquismo. Entre la copia, la adaptación y la creatividad
Abstract: During the first 20 years of Franco's dictatorship, the Spanish economy remained isolated, and technological innovation suffered a large backlog. Still, Spanish companies were able to advance technologically to gain advantage in the internal market taking advantage of import substitution. The article compares three firms with different characteristics located in Manresa (Barcelona), an industrial city with district behavior in certain sectors. Strategies for business innovation or technological license acquisition during autarchy and “development policy” are discussed.
The main contribution of the paper is the explanation of the mechanisms of development and spreading of innovation, and its close relation with the generation of external economies.
