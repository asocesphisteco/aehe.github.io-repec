Title: La transición nutricional en la España contemporánea: las variaciones en el consumo de pan, patatas y legumbres (1850-2000)
Abstract: This article analyses the contemporary nutritional changes of Spain. The process begins in the 19th century with the progressive improvement in food intake and in the nutritional status of the population up to 1930. This trend is interrupted for twenty years and begins to improve again definitively during the second half of the 20th century. This study focuses on the evolution of the intake of three central food groups of the Spanish diet up to the end of the 20th century: cereals, potatoes and pulses. This progression is also compared to the nutritional changes of other West European countries, highlighting its moderate delay and its final convergence.
