Title: Rural credit cooperatives in spain (1890?1935): a good start was not
enough
Abstract: The spread of agrarian credit cooperativism in Spain (1890?1934) was done under a variety of ideological and economic orientations. This article focuses on the construction of a few tools and indicators to explain the characteristics of agricultural credit cooperatives. An analysis of financial operations of rural savings banks is related with socio?political aspects that influenced their development; this analysis helps us to explain the relative success of German credit cooperative models adopted in the context of Spanish agriculture, as happened on European periphery.
